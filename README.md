# Homelessness-in-USA
This repository is written in R language and analyzes the current and past data about homeless people in USA

This project is made for personal development in Data mining, Data Analysis and Data Visualization. 
The project will be separated in different parts, with each part aiming to produce a chart, map or statistic relevant to given dataset. 
The tools used to produce the various visuals are ggplot2 in R and Tableau.

This is a project in development and as personal time allows I will add additional analysis to a very vast dataset.
